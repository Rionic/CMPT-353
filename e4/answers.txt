1. Based on your results for the last question, do you think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density? Briefly explain why or why not.

No because there isn't any visible correlation between the two. The points are scattered.

2. The larger data file (stations.json.gz) was kept compressed on disk throughout the analysis. Decompressing every time we run the program seems inefficient. Why might this be faster than working with an uncompressed .json data?

The uncompressed .json file has a size of 1.2MB whereas the compressed version is only 256KB. We save the time equivalent of reading through almost a whole MB of a .json file by compressing it, which is likely worth the decompression time.
