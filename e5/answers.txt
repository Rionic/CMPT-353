1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?

Sqrt got me the closest.

2. I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

For the original T-test, by rejecting the null hypothesis, we conclude that the mean counts of weekend comments vs. weekday comments have different values. For the transformed T-test, by rejecting the null hypothesis, we conclude that the mean counts of the square rooted number of comments on weekdays vs. weekends have different values.

3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

I would say fix #2, using the central limit theorem gets the best answer because the data seems to follow a normal distribution quite well while doing well on the equal-variance test and the only transformation we do is performing an average on each week and comparing those averages, which isn't too much of a transformation.

4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?

More comments posted on weekdays.
