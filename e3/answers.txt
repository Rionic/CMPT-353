1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice?

I think I got a better result with Kalman because I noticed it was able to captture the temperature spikes better than LOESS. LOESS seemed to have smoothed out the spikes too much.

2. In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude? [Aside: I tried, and it didn't help much. I think the values are calculated from the latitude/longitude by the app: they don't really add much new information.]

Speed could have been used with course to determine how fast you were going and in what direction, giving us the velocity. Time stamp would further enhance the velocity calculation as we could use the equation v=d/t where t is time obtained from timestamp and d is distance obtained from the longitude and latitude values.
