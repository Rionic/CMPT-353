1. Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value? Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?

The residuals are not close enough to being normal because conducting a normal test on the residuals yields a p-value of 5.17e-211 < 0.05 which means that we cannot conclude that the data is normal. Thus, we cannot conclude that the ratings are increasing.

2. Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise?

Yes because we have access to more data and have smaller time intervals which will help us predict the next time step more accurately.
